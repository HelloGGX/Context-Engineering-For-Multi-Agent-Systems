The Perseverance rover's primary mission on Mars is to seek signs of ancient life and collect samples of rock and regolith (broken rock and soil) for possible return to Earth. The rover has a drill to collect core samples of the most promising rocks and soils, and sets them aside in a "cache" on the surface of Mars. The mission also provides opportunities to gather knowledge and demonstrate technologies that address the challenges of future human expeditions to Mars. These include testing a method for producing oxygen from the Martian atmosphere, identifying other resources (such as subsurface water), improving landing techniques, and characterizing weather, dust, and other potential environmental conditions that could affect future astronauts living and working on Mars. Perseverance carries the Ingenuity Helicopter, a technology demonstration to test the first powered flight on Mars.
